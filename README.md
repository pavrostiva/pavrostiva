# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

ðŸš€ I'm a final-year BS+MS Bioinformatics student passionate about **omics data analysis** with a focus on **cancer research**.

---

## ðŸ§¬ About Me
I am deeply interested in studying cancer progression using bioinformatics. My current work involves multi-omics analysis to better understand oncogenesis.

---

## ðŸ’» Skills
**Proficient**: Python, R, single-cell RNA-seq (Seurat, Scanpy), data analysis, visualization  

**Comfortable**: Git, Bash, NGS data analysis, RNA-seq (batch effects, GO analysis, coexpression analysis), phylogenetic analysis, spatial analysis (Squidpy), WGS/WES (QC, trimming, mapping, SNP calling), basic machine learning (linear regression, cross-validation)  

**Familiar**: Docker, Nextflow, server management, basic lab skills (DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, vector cloning)

## ðŸ“ˆ Current Project
I am contributing to a comprehensive multi-omics project focused on the study of **oral cancer oncogenesis**. This project leverages data from single-cell transcriptomics, genomics, and metagenomics.
